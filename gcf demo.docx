Today's topic is about code search.
ServiceNow has developed a utility called "code search" which helps to search a code both within and outside of your application.
You can easily make changes in the code and find the location of variables used in the scripts.
Steps for how to use.
1)Type studio in the application navigation.Open the application studio and open any application.
2)on the upper right side corner you will find the code search option.
EX: you want to search a field 'u_name'.Go to code search and enter this number and it will display all the script name where it is used.
